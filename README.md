### Prerequisites

- Sir as of now, this program cant run properly on devices not on our LAN. The reason for this is that we used a local database that can only be accessed in LAN. We were not able to do remote
database since PLDT is a hassle when using admin capabalities such as port forwarding which is essential for remote control of the database.
