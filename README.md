## OOP Conncepts

This project applied the concepts of OOP as part of the requirements. Here are a few snippet showing the application of these concepts:

1. Classess and Objects (w/ fields)

2. Abstraction 
The process of scheduling a meeting involves several steps: querying the database for available time slots, checking conflicts, and then confirming the schedule. This method hides all those unnecessary details.

### Prerequisites

- Sir as of now, this program cant run properly on devices not on our LAN. The reason for this is that we used a local database that can only be accessed in LAN. We were not able to do remote
database since PLDT is a hassle when using admin capabalities such as port forwarding which is essential for remote control of the database.
